# AI Schema Designer

This project is a lightweight “AI-assisted tracking-plan and schema generator” designed to help product and analytics teams create clean, consistent event taxonomies. It produces event naming, triggers, descriptions, properties, and dbt-style schema YAML.

### Features
- Event tracking plan generator  
- dbt-style YAML schema output  
- Synthetic JSON/CSV sample events  
- Naming convention and taxonomy validation  
- Designed to be extendable with LLM-based enhancements  

### Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- PyYAML  

This project demonstrates how I use AI + automation to speed up product analytics workflows and build reliable tracking foundations for experimentation and growth analysis.
